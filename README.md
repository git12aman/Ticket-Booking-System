Ticket Booking System
Overview
This is a Ticket Booking System built in Java using JavaFX to provide a smooth graphical user interface (GUI). The system allows users to manage events, view event details, and book tickets. Users can add new events, view available events, book tickets based on availability, and view or cancel their bookings.

Cancel Booking: Cancel an existing booking.
